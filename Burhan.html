    My name is Joseph burhan. I made this website to share about things I like and if you are here for the free candy, people have lied to you... and stolen from you. In general, I enjoy trading card games, shows and books that build up fantasy worlds, and single player RPG video games. I value effort put into these non-essential things that are not needed to sustain our livelihoods but essential in maintaining my growing libi-*cough* I mean essential for umm, the things I live for... Yeah. This website is dumb and serves no purpose other than my own and to my friends to have a solid record of my likes to be used for or against me in a court and juryroom. I also added one more page if my like are not to your interest that shows my bucketlist, except I call it One Day, which means that I would eventually do these things one day, because I dislike the idea of me kicking the bucket for this. Now thank you for spending a good minute reading this, I bid you farewell, and look at some of the other pages please. I worked really hard on them. Okay maybe not that hard... 
    Also you face the mighty BREADNOUGHT
