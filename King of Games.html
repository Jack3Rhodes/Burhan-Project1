<h1>Trading Card Games:</h1>

            <li><b>Yu Gi Oh!</b></li>

                    My first trading card game that I invested in. But instead of buying the actualy cards, I spent my time on the PS2 game at home with NPCs I treat as my close friends. Those were the weird old days that I will always cherish because I loved this card game a lot that. In the end of it, I made real friends through Yu Gi Oh, well one friend and he is the *** autistic madman. Nowadays I play this game through the mobile app because real cards are still pricey for me</p>
            <li><b>Cardfight Vanguard</b></li>
                <img src="Dawn.jpg" style="float:right;width:100px;length:100px;">
                <p>
                    Was the game I spent most of my money at compared to the rest and ultimately short lived burst of hyped anticipation that was pointless. Vanguard was a relatively new cardfight game at the time that held so much potential and amazing looking art. The art quality increased but the overall gameplay was not fun anymore. It was about who had the better cards and how cards can only be played with a group of cards which limits playability. This card game grew stale for me, but Amber Dragon, Dawn will always be my <i>Aibo</i></p>

            <li><b>Magic The Gathering</b></li>

                <p>
                    I only tried Magic The Gathering recently and I love it purely for the mechanice. I think I would have been hooked on Magic the Gathering instead of Yu Gi Oh if I was introduced to it, because this game is crazy fun with so many variations to play. Yes objectively there are better sets of cards, but there were almost limitless possible playstyles to choose from. Again, real cards are pricey on my wallet so I play the online game which is still in beta and I am very new and my favorites are the dinosaurs because they look so cool in this game.</p>
            <li><b>Pokemon TCG Online</b></li>

                    I have been repeating about how pricey cards are. Well they are! So I play online and have minimal interaction with the community. But for Pokemon TCG Online, they place a mechanic where you are able to trade cards with other players from earning packs in the game. This single mechanic has me hooked in to playing because it encourages you to interact with the community online through trading. It feels like real life and it is something I cannot get from any other online card game. I would say this is the best trading card game online by far.</p>
